# AdGuard DNS HTTP API

The main HTTP API is served on the same port as the DNS-over-HTTP servers as well as on other addresses, if the [web configuration][conf-web] is set appropriately.

## Contents

- [Block Pages](#block-pages)
- [DNS Server Check](#dnscheck-test)
- [Linked IP Proxy](#linked-ip-proxy)
- [Static Content](#static-content)

[conf-web]: configuration.md#web

## <a href="#block-pages" id="block-pages" name="block-pages">Block Pages</a>

The safe-browsing, adult-blocking, and popup-blocking servers. Every request is responded with the content from the configured file, with the exception of `GET /favicon.ico` and `GET /robots.txt` requests, which are handled separately:

- `GET /favicon.ico` requests are responded with a plain-text `404 Not Found` response.

- `GET /robots.txt` requests are responded with:

    ```none
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /
    ```

The [static content](#static-content) is not served on these servers.

## <a href="#dnscheck-test" id="dnscheck-test" name="dnscheck-test">DNS Server Check</a>

`GET /dnscheck/test` is the DNS server check HTTP API. It should be requested with a random ID prepended to one of the [check domains][conf-check-domains] with a hyphen. The random ID must have from 4 to 63 characters and only include the alphanumeric characters and a hyphen.

<!--
    TODO(a.garipov): Describe the check process in details.
-->

Example of the request:

```sh
curl 'https://0123-abcd-dnscheck.example.com/dnscheck/test'
```

Example of the output:

```json
{
  "client_ip": "1.2.3.4",
  "device_id": "abcd1234",
  "profile_id": "defa5678",
  "protocol": "dot",
  "node_location": "ams",
  "node_name": "eu-1.dns.example.com",
  "server_group_name": "adguard_dns_default",
  "server_name": "default_dns",
  "server_type": "private"
}
```

The `protocol` field can have one of the following values:

- `"dns": Plain DNS.
- `"dnscrypt": DNSCrypt.
- `"doh": DNS-over-HTTP.
- `"doq": DNS-over-QUIC.
- `"dot": DNS-over-TLS.

The `server_type` field can have one of the following values:

- `"private"`: A private AdGuard DNS server is used.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This does not mean that the server has recognized the user's device. See the `device_id` and `profile_id` properties for that.

- `"public"`: A public AdGuard DNS server is used.

## <a href="#linked-ip-proxy" id="linked-ip-proxy" name="linked-ip-proxy">Linked IP Proxy</a>

The linked IP and Dynamic DNS (DDNS, DynDNS) HTTP proxy. If the [linked IP configuration][conf-web-linked_ip] is not empty, the following queries are either processed or proxied to [`LINKED_IP_TARGET_URL`][env-linked_ip_target_url].

- `GET  /robots.txt`: a special response is served, see below.
- `GET  /linkip/{device_id}/{encrypted}/status`: proxied.
- `GET  /linkip/{device_id}/{encrypted}`: proxied.
- `POST /ddns/{device_id}/{encrypted}/{domain}`: proxied.
- `POST /linkip/{device_id}/{encrypted}`: proxied.

In the case of a `GET /robots.txt` request, the following content is served:

```none
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

The [static content](#static-content) is not served on the linked IP addresses.

[conf-web-linked_ip]: configuration.md#web-linked_ip
[env-linked_ip_target_url]: environment.md#LINKED_IP_TARGET_URL

## <a href="#static-content" id="static-content" name="static-content">Static Content</a>

The static content server. Enabled if the [static content configuration][conf-web-static_content] is not empty. Static content is not served on the linked IP proxy server and the safe browsing and adult blocking servers.

[conf-web-static_content]: configuration.md#web-static_content
