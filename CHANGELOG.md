## AGDNS-2507 / Build 926

- Profile's file cache version was incremented. The file cache structure has been optimized, so messages like the following are to be expected:

    ```none
    profiledb: warning: error loading fs cache err="decoding protobuf: proto: cannot parse invalid wire-format data"
    ```

## AGDNS-2327 / Build 916

- Profile's file cache version was incremented. The new field `BlockChromePrefetch` has been added to profile's object.

    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
        block_firefox_canary: true
        block_private_relay: true
    ```

    with this:

        allowlist:
            # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …

        ipv4:
            rps: 30
        ipv6:
            rps: 300
    ```

  with this:

    ```yaml

    ```yaml
    check:
        # …
        ttl: 30s
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    check:

        refresh_timeout: 1m
    ```

## AGDNS-1954 / Build 726

- The object `web` has a new optional property, `general_blocking`. Its format is the same as in `adult_blocking` and `safe_browsing`.

## AGDNS-1954 / Build 719

- The objects within the `server_groups` array have a new property `block_page_redirect`:

    ```yaml
    block_page_redirect:
        enabled: true
        ipv4:
          - address: '127.0.0.1'

            question:
              - domain: 'do-not-show-block.site.example'
        probability: 0.01
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For `ipv4` and `ipv6` only one address is currently supported.

    For server groups that do not require a block-page redirect, set:

    ```yaml
    block_page_redirect:
        enabled: false
    ```

## AGDNS-1888 / Build 717

- The new environment variable `PROFILES_ENABLED` has been added. With `0` value it disables user profiles and devices recognition, and billing. Its default value is `1`. Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1761 / Build 702

- The property `upstream` has been modified. Its property `timeout` has been replaced with the new property `servers.timeout` for each server in the `servers` list. Concomitantly the `fallback.timeout` has been replaced with `fallback.servers.timeout` for each fallback server. The `fallback.servers` now supports not only the addresses of the servers, but URLs in the `[scheme://]ip:port` format like it's done with the main servers. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        # …
        servers:
          - 'tcp://1.1.1.1:53'
          - '127.0.0.1:5358'
        timeout: 2s
        fallback:
            servers:
              - 8.8.4.4:53
            timeout: 1s
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        # …
        servers:
          - address: 'tcp://1.1.1.1:53'
            timeout: 2s
          - address: '127.0.0.1:5358'
            timeout: 2s
        fallback:
            servers:
              - address: '8.8.4.4:53'
                timeout: 1s
    ```

    Adjust the value and add new ones, if necessary.

## AGDNS-698 / Build 701

- The object `dns` has new properties: `read_timeout`, `tcp_idle_timeout`, and `write_timeout`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    dns:
        max_udp_response_size: 1024B
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    dns:
        read_timeout: 2s
        tcp_idle_timeout: 30s
        write_timeout: 2s
        handle_timeout: 1s
        max_udp_response_size: 1024B
    ```

    The values in the example are previous defaults.

## AGDNS-1751 / Build 691

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        # …
        server: `8.8.8.8:53`
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        # …
        servers:
          - `8.8.8.8:53`
    ```

    Adjust the value and add new ones, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1759 / Build 684

- The object `backend` has a new property, `full_refresh_retry_interval`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        # …
        full_refresh_interval: 24h
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        # …
        full_refresh_interval: 24h
        full_refresh_retry_interval: 1h
    ```

    Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1744 / Build 681

## AGDNS-1738 / Build 678

- Object `dns` has a new property, describing maximum size of DNS response over UDP protocol.

    ```yaml
    dns:
        max_udp_response_size: 1024B
        handle_timeout: 1s
    ```

## AGDNS-1735 / Build 677

- The property `upstream.fallback` has been changed. Its former content is moved to the newly added property `servers`. The new property `timeout`, which describes query timeout to fallback servers, was added. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        fallback:
        - 1.1.1.1:53
        - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        fallback:
            servers:
            - 1.1.1.1:53
            - 8.8.8.8:53
            timeout: 1s
    ```

   Adjust the new values, if necessary. Note that the query timeout to fallback servers was previously defined with `upstream.timeout` property, which now describes the query timeout to the primary servers only.

## AGDNS-1178 / Build 676

       back_off_period: 10m
       back_off_count: 1000
       back_off_duration: 30m
   ```

   with this:

   ```yaml
   ratelimit:
       backoff_period: 10m

    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1566 / Build 549

- There is now a new env variable `RESEARCH_LOGS` that controls whether logging of additional info for research purposes is enabled. These log records can be filtered out by `research:` prefix. The default value is `0`, i.e. additional logging is disabled. The first thing that is logged in this version is domains which responses have ECH config. The log will only be recorded when both `RESEARCH_LOGS` and `RESEARCH_METRICS` are set to `1`.

- Added a new research metric `dns_research_response_ech` that counts the number of responses with a ECH configuration.

## AGDNS-1556 / Build 547

- The object `cache` has a new property `ttl_override`. It describes the TTL override settings, such as the minimum TTL for cache items and the `enabled` switch. It overwrites the TTL from DNS response in case it's less than this minimum value. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    cache:
        type: "simple"
        size: 10000
        ecs_size: 10000

        ttl_override:
            enabled: true
            # The minimum duration of TTL for a cache item.
            min: 60s
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1498 / Build 527

- Object `ratelimit` has a new property, `connection_limit`, which allows setting stream-connection limits. Example configuration:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …
        connection_limit:
            enabled: true
            stop: 1000
            resume: 800
    ```

## AGDNS-1383 / Build 525

- The environment variable `PROFILES_CACHE_PATH` is now sensitive to the file extension. Use `.json` for the previous behavior of encoding the cache into a JSON file or `.pb` for encoding it into protobuf. Other extensions are invalid.

## AGDNS-1381 / Build 518

- The new object `network` has been added:

    ```yaml
    network:
        so_sndbuf: 0
        so_rcvbuf: 0
    ```

## AGDNS-1383 / Build 515

- The environment variable `PROFILES_CACHE_PATH` now has a new special value, `none`, which disables profile caching entirely. The default value of `./profilecache.json` has not been changed.

## AGDNS-1479 / Build 513

- The profile-cache version has been changed to `6`. Versions of the profile cache from `3` to `5` are invalid and should not be reused.

## AGDNS-1473 / Build 506

- The profile-cache version has been changed to `5`.

## AGDNS-1247 / Build 484

- The new object `interface_listeners` has been added:

    ```yaml
    interface_listeners:
        channel_buffer_size: 1000
        list:
            eth0_plain_dns:
                interface: 'eth0'
                port': 53
            eth0_plain_dns_secondary:
                interface: 'eth0'
                port': 5353
    ```

- The objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array have a new optional property, `bind_interfaces`:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        servers:
          - name: 'default_dns'
            # …
            bind_interfaces:
              - id: 'eth0_plain_dns'
                subnet: '127.0.0.0/8'
              - id: 'eth0_plain_dns_secondary'
                subnet: '127.0.0.0/8'
    ```

    It is mutually exclusive with the current `bind_addresses` field.

## AGDNS-1406 / Build 480

- The default behavior of the environment variable `DNSDB_PATH` has been changed. Previously, if the variable was unset then the default value, `./dnsdb.bolt`, was used, but if it was an empty string, DNSDB was disabled. Now both unset and empty value disable DNSDB, which is consistent with the documentation.

    This means that DNSDB is disabled by default.

- The default configuration file path has been changed from `./config.yml` to `./config.yaml` for consistency with other services.

## AGDNS-916 / Build 456

- `ratelimit` now defines rate of requests per second for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses separately. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        rps: 30
        ipv4_subnet_key_len: 24
        ipv6_subnet_key_len: 48
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        ipv4:
            rps: 30
            subnet_key_len: 24
        ipv6:
            rps: 300
            subnet_key_len: 48
    ```

## AGDNS-907 / Build 449

- The objects within the `filtering_groups` have a new property, `block_firefox_canary`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
        block_firefox_canary: true
    ```

    The recommended default value is `true`.

## AGDNS-1308 / Build 447

- There is now a new env variable `RESEARCH_METRICS` that controls whether collecting research metrics is enabled or not. Also, the first research metric is added: `dns_research_blocked_per_country_total`, it counts the number of blocked requests per country. Its default value is `0`, i.e. research metrics collection is disabled by default.

## AGDNS-1051 / Build 443

- There are two changes in the keys of the `static_content` map. Firstly, properties `allow_origin` and `content_type` are removed. Secondly, a new property, called `headers`, is added. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    static_content:
        '/favicon.ico':
            # …
            allow_origin: '*'
            content_type: 'image/x-icon'
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    static_content:
        '/favicon.ico':
            # …
            headers:
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin':
                  - '*'
                'Content-Type':
                  - 'image/x-icon'
    ```

    Adjust or add the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1278 / Build 423

- The object `filters` has two new properties, `rule_list_cache_size` and `use_rule_list_cache`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        safe_search_cache_size: 1024
        refresh_interval: 1h
        refresh_timeout: 5m
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        safe_search_cache_size: 1024
        rule_list_cache_size: 10000
        refresh_interval: 1h
        refresh_timeout: 5m
        use_rule_list_cache: true
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1278 / Build 422

- The object `filters` has a new property, `safe_search_cache_size`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        refresh_interval: 1h
        refresh_timeout: 5m
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        safe_search_cache_size: 1024
        refresh_interval: 1h
        refresh_timeout: 5m
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1174 / Build 397

- DNS Server Check now responds with NODATA message to all non-A neither non-AAAA requests.

## AGDNS-911 / Build 375

- Added support for running a DoH3 server. No configuration changes are required to run it. If there was a DoH server configured, it will start listening for HTTP/3 connections on the same port where it listens for HTTP/2. Make sure that udp/443 is allowed in the iptables configuration on the server.

## AGDNS-842 / Build 372

- The new environment variable `PROFILES_CACHE_PATH` has been added. Its default value is `./profilecache.json`. Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-891 / Build 371

- The property `server` of `upstream` object has been changed. Now it is a URL optionally starting with `tcp://` or `udp://`, and then an address in `ip:port` format.

    ```yaml
    upstream:
       server: 'tcp://8.8.8.8:53'
    ```

    Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-1032 / Build 363

- The new optional field `static_content.*.allow_origin` has been added:

    ```yaml
    static_content:
        '/favicon.ico':
            allow_origin: '*'
    ```

## AGDNS-898 / Build 359

- The new optional object `additional_metrics_info` has been added:

    ```yaml
    additional_metrics_info:
        test_key: 'test_value'
    ```

## AGDNS-986 / Build 346

- The new object `upstream.healthcheck` now contains all healthcheck-related fields, including the new field `domain_template`. Property `upstream.healthcheck_backoff_time` has been moved to `upstream.healthcheck.backoff_duration`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.1:53
        timeout: 2s
        healthcheck_enabled: true
        healthcheck_interval: 2s
        healthcheck_timeout: 1s
        healthcheck_backoff_time: 30s
        fallback:
          - 1.1.1.1:53
          - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.1:53
        timeout: 2s
        fallback:
          - 1.1.1.1:53
          - 8.8.8.8:53
        healthcheck:
            enabled: true
            interval: 2s
            timeout: 1s
            backoff_duration: 30s
            domain_template: '${RANDOM}.neverssl.com'
    ```

    Adjust the new value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-960 / Build 342

- The property `domain` of `check` object has been changed to `domains`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    check:
       domain: "example.com"
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    check:
       domains:
       - 'example.com'
       - 'example.org'
    ```

    Adjust the news values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-838 / Build 338

- The object `upstream` has new properties, `healthcheck_enabled`, `healthcheck_interval`, `healthcheck_timeout`, and `healthcheck_backoff_time`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.9:53
        timeout: 2s
        fallback:
        - 1.1.1.1:53
        - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.9:53
        timeout: 2s
        healthcheck_enabled: true
        healthcheck_interval: 2s
        healthcheck_timeout: 1s
        healthcheck_backoff_time: 30s
        fallback:
        - 1.1.1.1:53
        - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    Adjust the new values, if necessary.

## Build 336

- The environment variable `SSLKEYLOGFILE` has been renamed to `SSL_KEY_LOG_FILE`.

## AGDNS-915 / Build 334

- The properties `subnet_key_ip_4_mask_len` and `subnet_key_ip_6_mask_len` of object `ratelimit` have been renamed to `ipv4_subnet_key_len` and `ipv6_subnet_key_len` correspondingly. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …
        subnet_key_ip_4_mask_len: 24
        subnet_key_ip_6_mask_len: 48
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …
        ipv4_subnet_key_len: 24
        ipv6_subnet_key_len: 48
    ```

## AGDNS-915 / Build 333

- The `ratelimit` object has two new properties, `subnet_key_ip_4_mask_len` and `subnet_key_ip_6_mask_len`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        # …
        subnet_key_ip_4_mask_len: 24
        subnet_key_ip_6_mask_len: 48
    ```

## AGDNS-897 / Build 329

- The objects within the `filtering_groups` have a new property, `block_private_relay`.

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
        block_private_relay: false
    ```

    The recommended default value is `false`.

## AGDNS-624 / Build 320

- The objects within `server_groups` array had a change in their DDR configuration. There was an opinion that the previous configuration was too limiting and that denormalized configuration is more self-describing. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        ddr_names:
        - 'dns.example.com'
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        ddr:
            enabled: true
            device_records:
                '*.d.dns.example.com':
                    doh_path: '/dns-query{?dns}'
                    https_port: 443
                    quic_port: 853
                    tls_port: 853
                    ipv4_hints:
                    - 127.0.0.1
                    ipv6_hints:
                    - '::1'
            public_records:
                'dns.example.com':
                    doh_path: '/dns-query{?dns}'
                    https_port: 443
                    quic_port: 853
                    tls_port: 853
                    ipv4_hints:
                    - 127.0.0.1
                    ipv6_hints:
                    - '::1'
        # …
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary. Make sure to synchronize and keep in sync the addresses and ports with the values of the server groups' servers.

## AGDNS-624 / Build 317

- The objects within `server_groups` array have a new property `ddr_names`:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        ddr_names:
        - 'dns.example.com'
        # …
    ```

    It is empty by default. These values will be used for constructing a response for Discovery of Designated Resolvers. Empty value leads to a NODATA response. Adjust the new value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-624 / Build 314

- The property `tls` of objects within the `server_groups.*.servers.*` array has been moved to the `server_group` object becoming common for the whole group. Any group having at least a single server of DoH/DoT/DoQ protocols will require the `tls` property specified. Any group having no encrypted resolvers will require the `tls` property absence. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dot
            protocol: tls
            tls:
                # …
            # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        tls:
            # …
        # …
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dot
            protocol: tls
            # …
    ```

    Adjust the new value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-829 / Build 308

- The object `upstream` has a new property, `timeout`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.9:53
        fallback:
        - 1.1.1.1:53
        - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    upstream:
        server: 127.0.0.9:53
        timeout: 2s
        fallback:
        - 1.1.1.1:53
        - 8.8.8.8:53
    ```

    Adjust the new value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-286 / Build 307

- The new object `connectivity_check` has been added:

    ```yaml
    connectivity_check:
        probe_ipv4: '8.8.8.8:53'
        probe_ipv6: '[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53'
    ```

## AGDNS-745 / Build 298

- The object `filters` has a new property, `refresh_timeout`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        refresh_interval: 1h
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 5m
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        refresh_interval: 1h
        refresh_timeout: 5m
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-608 / Build 273

- The object `cache` has two new properties, `type` and `ecs_size`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    cache:
        size: 10000
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    cache:
        type: "simple"
        size: 10000
        ecs_size: 10000
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-327 / Build 259

- Prometheus metric `dns_tls_handshake_total` has been updated with `server_name` label. This label represents "Server Name Indication" identifiers, grouped by endpoint identifier and known server names. All unknown server names are grouped in `other` label:

    ```none
    # TYPE dns_tls_handshake_total counter
    dns_tls_handshake_total{cipher_suite="TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",did_resume="0",negotiated_proto="",proto="tls",server_name="default_dot: other",tls_version="tls1.3"} 4
    ```

## AGDNS-607 / Build 258

- The special "disallow-all" response is served on `/robots.txt` requests to `web` module.

## AGDNS-506 / Build 242

- The property `cache_size` of object `geoip` has been renamed to `ip_cache_size`. Also, a new property named `host_cache_size` has been added. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    geoip:
        cache_size: 100000
        refresh_interval: 1h
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    geoip:
        host_cache_size: 100000
        ip_cache_size: 100000
        refresh_interval: 1h
    ```

    Adjust the new value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-505 / Build 238

- The object `backend` has a new property, `bill_stat_interval`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        timeout: 10s
        refresh_interval: 15s
        full_refresh_interval: 24h
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        timeout: 10s
        refresh_interval: 15s
        full_refresh_interval: 24h
        bill_stat_interval: 15s
    ```

    Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-187 / Build 228

- The new required environment variables `GENERAL_SAFE_SEARCH_URL` and `YOUTUBE_SAFE_SEARCH_URL` has been added. Those are expected to lead to plain text filters, for example:

    ```sh
    GENERAL_SAFE_SEARCH_URL='https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/engines_safe_search.txt'
    YOUTUBE_SAFE_SEARCH_URL='https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/youtube_safe_search.txt'
    ```

## AGDNS-344 / Build 226

- The environment variables `CONSUL_DNSCHECK_KV_URL` and `CONSUL_DNSCHECK_SESSION_URL` are now unset by default. Which means that by default HTTP key-value database isn't used.

## AGDNS-431 / Build 211

- The object `web` has a new optional property, `linked_ip`:

    ```yaml
    web:
        linked_ip:
            bind:
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:80
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:443
                certificates:
                -
                    certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                    key: ./test/cert.key
    ```

## AGDNS-425 / Build 209

- The objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array have a new optional property, `linked_ip_enabled`. It is `false` by default. Set to `true` to enable linked IP address detection on that server:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dns
            protocol: dns
            linked_ip_enabled: true
            # …

## AGDNS-405 / Build 195

- Used our fork of miekg/dns library to fix the EDNS0 TCP keep-alive issue.

## AGDNS-341 / Build 183

- Removed the static DNS check `/info.txt`. Now that `web` module is available, it is no more needed since it can be configured via the `web` module.

## AGDNS-341 / Build 179

- The object `doh` has been removed.

- The new optional object `web` has been added:

    ```yaml
    web:
        safe_browsing:
            bind:
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:80
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:443
                certificates:
                -
                    certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                    key: ./test/cert.key
            block_page: /path/to/block_page.html
        adult_blocking:
            bind:
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:80
            -
                address: 127.0.0.1:443
                certificates:
                -
                    certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                    key: ./test/cert.key
            block_page: /path/to/block_page.html
        non_doh_bind:
        -
            address: 127.0.0.1:80
        -
            address: 127.0.0.1:443
            certificates:
            -
                certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                key: ./test/cert.key
        static_content:

        error_500: /path/to/error_500.html
        timeout: 1m
    ```

## AGDNS-367 / Build 164

- The object `geoip` has a new property, `cache_size`.

## AGDNS-310 / Build 153

- The environment variable `LOG_OUTPUT` has been removed. Logs are now always written to stdout.

## AGDNS-339 / Build 136

- The environment variable `DNSDB_PATH` is now unset by default. Which means that by default DNSDB is disabled.

## AGDNS-350 / Build 135

- The new optional environment variable `SSLKEYLOGFILE` has been added.

## AGDNS-345 / Build 133

- The object `check` has a new property, `node_location`.

## AGDNS-322 / Build 116

- The property `device_id_wildcard_domains` in the objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array has been renamed to the shorter `device_id_wildcards`.

- The DNS names from certificates are not used to detect device IDs and perform additional validations anymore.

## AGDNS-305 / Build 114

- The new required environment variable `BLOCKED_SERVICE_INDEX_URL` has been added. It has no default value, so it's necessary to set it.

## AGDNS-319 / Build 113

- The objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array have a new property, `tls.device_id_wildcard_domains`. It is an array of domain name wildcards used to detect device IDs. If necessary, add them:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        # …
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dot
            # …
            tls:
                # …
                device_id_wildcard_domains:
                - *.dns.adguard.com
    ```

## AGDNS-292 / Build 111

- The environment variable `CONSUL_URL` has been renamed to `CONSUL_ALLOWLIST_URL`.

- The new required environment variables `CONSUL_DNSCHECK_KV_URL` and `CONSUL_DNSCHECK_SESSION_URL` are added. They have no default value, so it's necessary to set them.

- The object `check` has a new property, `ttl`. Set it to a human-readable duration, for example `1m`.

## AGDNS-296 / Build 110

- The property `parental.safe_search` of objects within the `filtering_groups` array is renamed to `parental.general_safe_search` to synchronize it with the backend.

## Build 109

- The object `log` has been removed. Its properties have been moved to the environment.

- The new environment variable `LOG_OUTPUT` has been added. It is the path to the plain text log file. If `stdout`, writes to standard output. If `stderr`, writes to standard error.

    The default value is `stdout`, adjust the value, if necessary.

- The new environment variable `LOG_TIMESTAMP` has been added. When it is set to `1`, timestamps are shown in the plain text logs. When set to `0`, they are not shown.

    The default value is `1`, adjust the value, if necessary.

- The environment variable `VERBOSE` doesn't support a set but empty value. Unset the value or replace it with a `0`.

## AGDNS-295 / Build 105

- Another change in the objects within the `filtering_groups`. Before:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        filters:
        - adguard_dns_filter
        parental: true
        block_adult: true
        safe_browsing: true
        safe_search: true
        youtube_safe_search: true
    ```

    After:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        parental:
            enabled: true
            block_adult: true
            safe_search: true
            youtube_safe_search: true
        rule_lists:
            enabled: true
            ids:
            - adguard_dns_filter
        safe_browsing:
            enabled: true
    ```

## AGDNS-290 / Build 97

- The object `check` has a new property, `node_name`.

## AGDNS-287 / Build 96

- The objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array have a new optional property in their `dnscrypt` objects, `inline`. Also, the property `config` is renamed to `config_path`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        name: adguard_dns_default
        filtering_group: default
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dnscrypt
            # …
            dnscrypt:
                config: './test/dnscrypt.yml'
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        name: adguard_dns_default
        filtering_group: default
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dnscrypt
            # …
            dnscrypt:
                inline:
                    provider_name: 2.dnscrypt-cert.example.org
                    public_key: F11DDBCC4817E543845FDDD4CB881849B64226F3DE397625669D87B919BC4FB0

                    resolver_secret: 9E46E79FEB3AB3D45F4EB3EA957DEAF5D9639A0179F1850AFABA7E58F87C74C4
                    resolver_public: 9327C5E64783E19C339BD6B680A56DB85521CC6E4E0CA5DF5274E2D3CE026C6B
                    es_version: 1
                    certificate_ttl: 8760h
        # …
    ```

    or this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        name: adguard_dns_default
        filtering_group: default
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dnscrypt
            # …
            dnscrypt:
                config_path: './test/dnscrypt.yml'
        # …
    ```

    Adjust the values, if necessary.

## AGDNS-290 / Build 95

- The property `server_name` of object `check` is removed.

## AGDNS-272 / Build 94

- The new optional object `doh` has been added, which supplements the DNS-over-HTTP server configuration. Example:

    ```yaml
    doh:
        root_redirect_url: "https://adguard-dns.com/"
    ```

## AGDNS-140 / Build 90

- The objects within the `server_groups.*.servers` array have a new property, `tls.session_keys`. So, if necessary, replace this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        name: adguard_dns_default
        filtering_group: default
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dot
            # …
            tls:
                certificates:
                -
                    certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                    key: ./test/cert.key
        # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    server_groups:
    -
        name: adguard_dns_default
        filtering_group: default
        servers:
        -
            name: default_dot
            # …
            tls:
                certificates:
                -
                    certificate: ./test/cert.crt
                    key: ./test/cert.key
                session_keys:
                - ./private/key_1
        # …
    ```

## AGDNS-233 / Build 88

- The object `backend` has a new property, `full_refresh_interval`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        timeout: 10s
        refresh_interval: 1m
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    backend:
        timeout: 10s
        refresh_interval: 1m
        full_refresh_interval: 24h
    ```

    Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-247 / Build 86

- The new object `check` has been added, which configures the DNS checks mechanism. Example:

    ```yaml
    check:
        domain: "dnscheck.adguard.com"
        ipv4:
        - 1.2.3.4
        - 5.6.7.8
        ipv6:
        - 1234::cdee
        - 1234::cdef
        server_name: "AdGuard DNS Default"
    ```

## AGDNS-246 / Build 83

- The new environment variable `RULESTAT_URL` has been added. Its default value is an empty string, which means that no statistics are gathered. Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-245 / Build 74

- The new environment variable `DNSDB_PATH` has been added. Its default value is `./dnsdb.bolt`. Adjust the value, if necessary.

## AGDNS-139 / Build 73

- The ratelimit configuration for a server has changed from this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        refuseany: true
        response_size_limit: 1KB
        rate_limit_cache_ttl: 10m
        back_off_cache_ttl: 30m
        rps: 30
        backoff_limit: 1000
    ```

    to this:

    ```yaml
    ratelimit:
        allowlist:
            list:
            - '127.0.0.1'
            - '127.0.0.1/24'
            refresh_interval: 30s
        back_off_count: 1000

- Property `url` of the `filters.lists` objects is now required.

## AGDNS-188 / Build 61

- The type of the `cache.size` property was changed from bytes to integer. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    cache:
        size: 50KB
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    cache:
        size: 10000
    ```

    Set the new values accordingly.

## AGDNS-149, AGDNS-150, AGDNS-189 / Build 52

- The top-level object `parental` was renamed to `adult_blocking`.

- The objects `safe_browsing` and `adult_blocking` have four new properties, `cache_size`, `cache_ttl`, `refresh_interval`, and `url`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    safe_browsing:
        block_host: standard-block.dns.adguard.com
        list: ./test/safe_browsing.txt

    adult_blocking:
        block_host: family-block.dns.adguard.com
        list: ./test/parental.txt

        cache_size: 1024
        cache_ttl: 1h
        list: ./test/parental.txt
        refresh_interval: 1h
    ```

    Set the new values accordingly.

- The objects within the `filtering_groups` array have a new property, `block_adult`. So replace this:

    ```yaml

        safe_browsing: true
        safe_search: false
        youtube_safe_search: false
    # …
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -

        - adguard_dns_filter
        parental: false
        block_adult: false
        safe_browsing: true
        safe_search: false
        youtube_safe_search: false
    # …
    ```

    Set the new value accordingly.

- The objects within the `filters.lists` array have a new property, `refresh_interval`. The property is only required when the property `url` is also set. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        # …
        lists:
        -
            id: adguard_dns_filter
            url: 'https://example.com/adguard_dns_filter.txt'
            path: ./test/filters/adguard_dns_filter.txt
        -
            id: peter_lowe_list
            path: ./test/filters/peter_lowe_list.txt
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml

        -
            id: adguard_dns_filter
            url: 'https://example.com/adguard_dns_filter.txt'
            path: ./test/filters/adguard_dns_filter.txt
            refresh_interval: 1h
        -
            id: peter_lowe_list
            path: ./test/filters/peter_lowe_list.txt
    ```

    Set the new value accordingly.

## Build 45

- The property `youtube_restricted` was renamed to `youtube_safe_search`. So replace this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
        youtube_restricted: false
    -
        id: strict
        # …
        youtube_restricted: true
    ```

    with this:

    ```yaml
    filtering_groups:
    -
        id: default
        # …
        youtube_safe_search: false
    -
        id: strict
        # …
        youtube_safe_search: true
    ```

## AGDNS-152 / Build 43

- The blocked response TTL parameter has been moved and renamed. From this:

    ```yaml
    dns:
        blocked_response_ttl: 10s
    ```

    to this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        response_ttl: 10s
    ```

    The `dns` object has been completely removed.

## AGDNS-177 / Build 40

- The TLS configuration for a server has changed from this:

    ```yaml
    tls:
        certificates:
        -
            certificate: /test/cert.crt
            key: /test/cert.key
        domains:
        - dns.adguard.com
    ```

    to this:

    ```yaml
    tls:
        certificates:
        -
            certificate: /test/cert.crt
            key: /test/cert.key
    ```

    The domains to be used in device ID detection are now expected to be contained in the certificate's DNS Names section of SAN.

## AGDNS-167 / Build 39

- The filtering configuration has changed from this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
    -
        id: adguard_dns_filter
        path: ./tmp.dir/filter.txt
    ```

    to this:

    ```yaml
    filters:
        custom_filter_cache_size: 1024
        lists:
        -
            id: adguard_dns_filter
            path: ./tmp.dir/filter.txt
    ```
